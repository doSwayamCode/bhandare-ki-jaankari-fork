## Inspiration behind the Project  
The reason why I choosed this idea was because in India, every day someone goes to sleep with empty stomach.
Not because food is not being cooked…but because it is not reaching them.
That thought stayed with me. And while I can’t solve this massive problem overnight, I wanted to do something small but meaningful.

I am not claiming this will end hunger. But if even a few more people find their way to food through this, Iwill call it worth it.
